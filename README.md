Title: Longitudinal Clustering Analysis and Prediction of Parkinson’s Disease Progression using Radiomics and Hybrid Machine Learning

Data: We employed 981 features (listed in "name of features" file) including multiple Movement Disorder Society’s Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) measures, a range of task/exam performances, socioeconomic/family histories, genetic features, and SPECT image based radiomics features. We also considered a table as dictionary at the end of "name of features" file.

i) Feature extraction method (FEA)
1)	PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
2)	Kernel PCA 
3)	t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) 
4)	Factor analysis (FA)
5)	SMA (Sammon Mapping algorithm) 
6)	IsoA (Isomap Algorithm)
7)	LMIsoA (LandMark Isomap Algorithm)
8)	LEA (Laplacian Eigenmaps Algorithm)
9)	LLEA (locally linear embedding algorithm)
10)	MDSA (multidimensional scaling Algorithm) 
11)	DMA (Diffusion map Algorithm)
12)	SPEA (Stochastic Proximity Embedding Algorithm)
13)	GPLVM (Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model)
14)	SNEA (Stochastic Neighbor Embedding Algorithm)
15)	Sym_SNEA (symmetric Stochastic Neighbor Embedding Algorithm)
16)	AA (Autoencoders Algorithms) 


ii) Clustering algorithm

KMeans algorithm

iii) Hoteling t2 test
